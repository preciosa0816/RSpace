## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
train_list=createDataPartition(y=iris$Species,p=0.6, list=FALSE)#60%확률 
iris_train=iris[train_list,]
iris_test=iris[-train_list,]

f=randomForest(Species~.,data=iris_train)
p=predict(f,newdata = iris_test)

p
iris_test$Species

```
